    3. How to Report
        - List all identified security issues in a JSON array.
        - Each element must strictly follow this structure:
          [[REVIEW_SCHEMA_FIELDS]]
        - IMPORTANT: If no identified security issues are found, return: {\"reviews\": []}

        2. Remove any issues that are false positives or are already mitigated in the code (e.g., null checks exist, safe boundaries are enforced, etc.).
        3. Keep only the issues that definitely represent real security risks.

        Do not introduce conclusions that are not supported by the .td contents or provided context.

        You will be given:
        1) FILE — a TableGen file (e.g., instruction/operand/register definitions, patterns, features).
        2) RELEVANT_CONTEXT — notes about target, subtarget features, expected semantics, and patches.

      security_review_checks: |-
        Your tasks:

          - Identify security-relevant mis-specifications in FILE that could alter program semantics or expose unsafe code paths. Focus on:
            * Incorrect codegen or pattern matches that generate unintended instructions.
            * Privileged or system instructions enabled on unsupported subtargets.
            * Missing side-effect or memory flags (e.g., hasSideEffects, mayLoad, mayStore) that allow illegal optimization or reordering.
            * Overly permissive immediates or operand definitions that permit invalid encodings.
            * Pseudo-instruction expansions dropping required barriers, implicit defs/uses, or side effects.
            * Incorrect ImplicitUses or ImplicitDefs that permit register clobbers or privilege transitions.
            * Missing Predicates or Requires clauses that fail to restrict instructions to correct modes or features.
            * Compression or relaxation patterns that unintentionally modify control flow or privilege level.
            * Scheduling or itinerary omissions that skip necessary fences or barriers, compromising temporal safety.

          - Validate correctness of the following TableGen constructs and attributes:
            * Instruction flags: hasSideEffects, mayLoad, mayStore, isBarrier, isPseudo, isCall, isReturn, isBranch, isTrap, isTerminator.
            * Feature gating: Predicates, Requires, and SubtargetFeature usage.
            * Operand and register definitions: RegisterClass, RegisterOperand, OperandWithDefaultOps, and AsmOperandClass.
            * Immediate constraints: ImmLeaf, ComplexPattern, and constant range validation.
            * Pseudo lowering: UsesCustomInserter, ExpandPseudo — verify preservation of side effects and operand semantics.
            * Pattern breadth: Pat<> and Pattern= constructs — flag overly generic operand or type matches.
            * ImplicitUses / ImplicitDefs accuracy — ensure all implicit dependencies are correctly modeled.

          - Perform Security Impact Analysis:
            * For each issue, describe the specific failure mode (e.g., “mayStore=0 on a memory op allows reordering across fences”).
            * Classify severity (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, CRITICAL) and identify relevant preconditions (target, subtarget feature, or execution mode).
            * Distinguish between compile-time acceptance issues (assembler/matcher) and runtime miscompiles or privilege violations.

          - Propose Minimal Reproduction Tests (non-executable):
            * Describe 1-2 targeted lit tests (TableGen/MC/CodeGen) that could expose the issue.
            * Include relevant patterns, features, or intrinsics to trigger the vulnerable behavior.

          - Recommend Remediation:
            * Provide specific TableGen fixes (flags, predicates, operand constraints, pseudo-lowering adjustments).
            * Include additional feature gating, implicit defs/uses, or barrier insertion as necessary.

             - Front-running / MEV risks and missing commit-reveal or slippage bounds for price-sensitive actions.
             - Insecure randomness (use of `block.timestamp`, `blockhash`, or predictable on-chain data for entropy).
             - Oracle manipulation risks and stale price assumptions.
             - Uninitialized storage pointers or incorrect storage/memory data location causing unintended storage writes.
             - Incorrect visibility or mutability (`public` when `external`/`internal` intended; missing `view`/`pure`; unnecessary `payable`).
             - Missing input validation and invariant checks; unsafe casting; unchecked array indices or length assumptions.
             - Upgradeable/proxy hazards (storage layout collisions, missing `initializer`/`reinitializer`, delegatecall to implementation from constructor).
             - Dangerous `selfdestruct`/`suicide` or ownership renouncement patterns; lost upgrade or recovery paths.
             - ERC20/721/1155 pitfalls (approve/transferFrom front-running, incorrect allowance updates, missing return value checks, missing events).
             - Hardcoded secrets or privileged addresses; reliance on `msg.sender` without proper trust boundaries.
           - Prioritize user-controlled inputs, value transfers, and external call sites.
           - Do not report on issues that do not affect security.

        2. What to Check
        - Look for potential security issues such as:
          - Unsafe code usage
            + Pay special attention to any `unsafe` blocks. Ensure they are justified and properly bounded.
            + Check for vulnerabilites relating to raw pointer dereferencing, FFI usage, use-after-free, and manual memory manipulation.
            + Ensure that lifetimes are correctly enforced when using references in unsafe or FFI code.
            + Be alert for transmute or lifetime erasure via raw pointers.
          - Concurrency issues
            + Watch for potential data races in `unsafe` code or improper use of synchronization primitives.
            + Specifically, check for removed `await`/`join` calls or altered locking logic that could introduce race conditions.
          - Integer overflows and underflows
          - Input validation and injection vulnerabilities
            + Look for places where user input is passed to command execution, file paths, or unsafe APIs.
          - Deserialization or parsing issues
            + If the code deserializes external input, ensure it properly validates the format and structure to prevent logic or memory vulnerabilities.
          - Hardcoded secrets
          - Insecure use of libraries
        - IMPORTANT: Rusts ownership model and borrow checker prevent many classes of bugs by design. Do not raise issues that are already statically prevented unless overridden by `unsafe` or FFI.
        - Do not report on issues that do not affect security.
